            My name is Devon Lewis. I'm a 1st year Computer Science PhD student
            at Rutgers University. I'm currently researching the intersection
            of microservice architectures and operating systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm deeply interested in computing and technology in general. I spend my time
            reading, gaming, configuring my desktop (Gentoo with Sway, running on a
            fanless PC), configuring Emacs (I'm simply in too deep), managing my home
            server (TrueNAS), and snowboarding. I also really like food.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am not interested in web design, embedded systems, algebra,
            Chicago juke, or olives. Regarding the first point, if this blog
            doesn't display nicely on your device I probably won't fix it unless you
            ask nicely. To do that, you can email me at
            dev[dot]&lt;last name&gt;611[at]gmail.com. I don't know why people
            obsfuscate their email like this but it seems cool so I will do it too.
