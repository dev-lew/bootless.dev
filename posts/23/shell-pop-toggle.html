      <h2>using shell-pop to toggle between eshell and ansi-term</h2>
      <div id="main">
	<p>
	  I use <a href="https://github.com/kyagi/shell-pop-el">shell-pop</a> to work with the terminal in emacs.
	  Binding the shell-pop function to a key (I use SPC ') creates a shell buffer on the bottom portion of the screen.
	  shell-pop supports eshell, term/ansi-term, and shell out of the box, but it can only be configured to use
	  one per invocation.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I recently got the urge to learn eshell, so I changed the shell-pop config accordingly ... and was annoyed.
	  There were still times I wanted to use ansi-term, and I was forced to resort to <code>M-x ansi-term</code>
	  which of course lacks the functionality of shell-pop. In the grand scheme of things,
	  this isn't a big deal, but I was willing to spend a silly amount of time writing a function to
	  extend shell-pop to be able to use both:
	</p>
	    <pre><code>
(defun choose-shell ()
  (interactive)
  (require 'helm)

  (helm :sources
	(helm-build-sync-source "Select Shell"
	  :candidates '("eshell" "ansi-term"))
	:buffer "*Select Shell"))

(defun configure-shell-pop ()
  (interactive)
  (require 'shell-pop)

   (let ((shell-choice (choose-shell)))

   (cond
   ((equal shell-choice "ansi-term")
    (setq shell-pop-shell-type
	  (quote ("ansi-term" "*ansi-term*"
	     (lambda () (ansi-term shell-pop-term-shell))))))
   ((equal shell-choice "eshell")
    (setq shell-pop-shell-type
	  (quote ("eshell" "*eshell*"
	     (lambda () (eshell))))))))
   (shell-pop--set-shell-type 'shell-pop-shell-type shell-pop-shell-type))
	    </code></pre>
	<p>
	  <code>choose-shell</code> opens a helm buffer allowing the user to choose ansi-term or eshell, and that
	  choice is stored in the <code>shell-choice</code> variable in the <code>configure-shell-pop</code> function.
	  Depending on the choice, we set the <code>shell-pop-shell-type</code> variable to the appropriate shell.
	  Following this function (which I bind to SPC ") any subsequent invocations of <code>shell-pop</code>
	  will use the chosen shell.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This setup does not delete the previous shell buffer if you switch while having one open, so you can
	  keep both in your buffer ring. Hopefully this can be of use to fellow shell-pop users!
	</p>
